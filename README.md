The app uses AccuWeather's API to retrieve the weather data for a certain number of days. It also uses the Google Places API to retrieve points of interest which fall under specific categories. An algorithm is developed in order to determine a score for each point of interest based on its category, distance, and the weather for that specific day. The app then displays the top points of interest based on the score.

The App was developed using the Xamarin Platform for Android.
